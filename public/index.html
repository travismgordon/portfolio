    <p>Hey there. Welcome to my portfolio site. I've lived in Miami for the last ten years and I have an unyielding passion for technology, design, and engineering. Also, food. I've worked in large teams and on my own from projects ranging from basic web design all the way to full documentary films and nearly everything in between, including marketing, graphic design, and special event journalism. Ruby is my newest flame, and shes amazing on Rails.</p> 
    <p>A bit more about myself; I've been married for almost five years, and my wife and I bake our own bread (she's way better at it). I have a secretly enjoy gaming and I absolutely love live music. I recently climbed the tallest church tower in the world as well as highest mountain on the Appalachian trail.Traveling is one of my favortie things in life. To quote Mark Twain, <div>"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime."</div></p>
    <p>Feel free to reach out to me, I love learning new things and meeting new people, but I especially adore new problems to solve. And dogs.</p>
